/**
 * -DESCRIPTION-
 * Selection sort does not adapt to the data in any way, so its runtime is always O(NÂ²). 
 * However, selection sort has the property of minimizing the number of swaps. 
 * In applications where the cost of swapping items is high, 
 * selection sort very well may be the algorithm of choice.
 * 
 * Notice that random access iterators aren't required.
 * 
**/

/**
 *  * UTILTIES *
 * std::min_element -> to find the remaining minimum element during iterations
 * std::iter_swap   -> to swap current with remaing minimum
 * NOTE:(implementation with std::swap(*it1, *it2) could fit in for almost all compillers)
**/

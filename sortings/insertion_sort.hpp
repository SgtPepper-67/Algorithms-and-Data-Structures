/**
 * -DESCRIPTION-
 * Insertion sort is one of the elementary sorting algorithms with O(NÂ²) worst-case time, 
 * insertion sort is the algorithm of choice either when the data is nearly sorted (because it is adaptive)
 * or when the problem size is small (because it has low overhead). For these reasons,
 * and because it is also stable, insertion sort is often used as the recursive base case 
 * (when the problem size is small) for higher overhead divide-and-conquer sorting algorithms, 
 * such as merge sort or quick sort.
**/

/**
 * -UTILTIES-
 * std::upper_bound -> to find the location where the current element needs to go(binary search by default)
 * std::rotate      -> to shift the remaining elements after insertion
**/

/**
 * Possible optimization:
 * Iterate from std::next(first), because first element 
 * already is in place/
**/

/**
 * @brief insertion sort template function
 * @param first: forward iterator to the beginning of the interval
 * @param last: forward iteratir ti the end of the interval
 * @param cmp: (optional) functor for comparing elements(std::less<> by default)
 * @return void
